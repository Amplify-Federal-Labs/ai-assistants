You can find large examples of Ada programming code in several places online. Here are some of the best resources:

## GitHub Repositories

* [AdaCore](https://github.com/AdaCore): AdaCore, the company behind the GNAT Ada compiler, hosts numerous open-source Ada projects on GitHub.1 You can find the GNAT compiler itself, the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS) IDE, various libraries (e.g., for web development, SPARK formal verification), and tools. These are actively maintained and represent substantial codebases.
* [Awesome Ada](https://github.com/ohenley/awesome-ada): This curated list of Ada resources includes links to many open-source projects, libraries, and tools. While not all are "large," it's an excellent starting point for discovering diverse Ada applications.

* Searching GitHub: You can directly search GitHub for projects written in Ada. Use the language filter ("language:ada") and sort by stars or forks to find popular and potentially large repositories. Look for projects related to:

  * Compilers and Development Tools: The GNAT compiler and related tools (like GNATcoverage, Libadalang) are themselves significant Ada projects.2
  * Embedded Systems and Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): Ada is frequently used in these domains.3 Search for projects related to specific hardware platforms or RTOS kernels.
  * Aerospace and Defense: While many of these are proprietary, some open-source examples or related tooling might exist.
  * GUI Frameworks: Projects like Gnoga (GNU Omnificent GUI for Ada) provide examples of larger application structures.
  * Libraries for various purposes: Networking, databases, etc.

## Other Resources

* [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/): Alire is the Ada Library Repository.4 It's a package manager for Ada and SPARK that also serves as a catalog of Ada libraries and projects.5 Many of these projects are open source and can be quite substantial. Alire itself is an open-source Ada project.6
* [AdaForge](https://www.adaforge.org/OtherResources/PublicRepos/): This site lists public repositories for Ada code, including links to major platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and SourceForge.
* [Ada-lang.io Projects](https://ada-lang.io/docs/projects-to-work-on/): The official Ada community website lists projects seeking contributors. Some of these are established, larger codebases.
* [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Ada): While focused on smaller, specific tasks, Rosetta Code provides numerous examples of how to solve common problems in Ada, which can be helpful for understanding language features in practice.7

When looking for "large" examples, consider that Ada is often used for long-lived, high-integrity systems.8 This means the codebase might be spread across many modules (packages in Ada terminology) and developed over extended periods.

To get a good understanding, try exploring projects that align with your interests or the domain you want to learn more about. Cloning a repository and exploring its structure and build process can be very insightful.
